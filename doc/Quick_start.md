# Quick start

This article will introduce how to configure and run the front-end project of the SaaS development framework locally, and you can conduct secondary business development based on this.

This article is divided into two parts, `Quick Experience` and `Development & Debugging`, which respectively introduce how to install and start the project and how to carry out secondary development.

## Environment dependency
- [Node.js â‰¥ 12.0.0](https://nodejs.org/en/) (It is recommended to install the LTS version)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
  - Install CLI: `npm i yarn -g`
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (Optional, used to build image)

## Quick experience
### Step 1: Start the interface service

The front-end project of the SaaS development framework requires the server to provide interface services. We provide the following two ways to start the interface services:

  1. [Run SaaS Development Framework Backend Project in Local Mode](https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/SaaSDevelopmentFramework_backend?id=Kaqcx9hwc9i62)

  2. [Run SaaS Development Framework Docker](https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/SaaSDevelopmentFramework_Image?id=Kapsg7pttb8f2) 
 
**ðŸ’¬ Description:**

  - If you just want to experience the development and debugging process of this project, it is recommended to use "Method 2" to start the interface service

  - The default interface service address is `http://localhost`, you can modify the configuration in [./setupProxy.js#L5](./setupProxy.js#L5) according to the actual situation

### Step 2: Installation

```bash
# Clone project
git clone git@github.com:tuya/iot-portal.git

# Jump to the directory where the project is located
cd ./iot-portal

# Use yarn to install dependencies
yarn
```

### Step 3: Compile the front-end project

```bash
# Use yarn to compile
yarn run build
```

The compiled file is as follows:

> <img width="180" src="./images/build.png" />

### Step 4: Start the http service

```bash
# Use yarn to start the service
yarn run start
```

At this point, the startup of the project is completed. The service listens to the port `8888` by default. Enter [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) in the browser to access it normally.

Next we look at how to debug and develop sub-applications.

## Development & Debug

The SaaS development framework uses a micro-front-end architecture. Each micro-front-end application is an independent project and needs to be configured with independent dependencies, and each micro-front-end application can be independently deployed and run independently. This article takes debugging [`./applications/asset-app`](./applications/asset-app) (account management sub-application) as an example to introduce you the development & debugging process.

### Step 1: Start the interface service

In order to reduce the difficulty of debugging, we use [Run SaaS Development Framework Docker](https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/SaaSDevelopmentFramework_Image?id=Kapsg7pttb8f2) to start the interface service.

After the interface service is started successfully, make sure that [`./setupProxy.js#L5`](./setupProxy.js#L5) is configured with the correct service address.


###Step 2: Launch the sub-application

```bash
# Enter the sub-application that needs to be debugged
cd ./applications/asset-app

# Launch sub-application
yarn run start
```

> After the service is started, enter [http://localhost:7001/asset-app/](http://localhost:7001/asset-app/) in the browser to access the sub-application.
> 
> Because we deploy sub-applications in the form of sub-directories, there will be a `/asset-app` path in the url address.
> 
> In addition, you can also modify the `7001` port of the sub-application in `./applications/asset-app/.env`.

#### Case 1: The interface service has not been started

After completing the compilation process, you can see the following interface in the browser

> <img width="550" src="./images/asset-app-empty.png" />
> 

#### Case 2: The interface service starts normally

After completing the compilation process, it will automatically jump to `http://localhost:7001/login`. This is because the interface request does not contain login information. The back-end service will throw an exception after receiving the request, and the front-end service is receiving an exception Later, if it is found that the login state is invalid, it will jump to `/login`, and the user needs to log in again.

> <img width="550" src="./images/asset-app-error.png" />

But our sub-application does not provide login function, now, we will turn the view back to the main application


### Step 3: Start the main application

Open a new command line window to start the main application, the process is similar to launching sub-applications.

```bash
# Enter the main application
cd ./applications/main-app

# Start the main application
yarn run start
```

After the startup is complete, it will come to the login page [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login) by default, as shown in the figure below. The default initialized account of the Docker service is:

 - Accountï¼šadmin@tuya.com
 - Passwordï¼šAdmin123456

> <img width="550" src="./images/main-app-login.png" />

After logging in successfully, you can enter the `asset-app`

> <img width="550" src="./images/asset-app.png" />

At this point, we have completed the startup of the nested debugging service of "main application + sub-application"


## Micro front end configuration instructions

The SaaS development framework is the basic [qiankun](https://qiankun.umijs.org/zh) implementation. The base application of the micro front end is `main-app`, and all sub-applications rely on the base application to load. The specific Configuration location [`./applications/main-app/src/qiankun`](./applications/main-app/src/qiankun)
